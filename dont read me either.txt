hello person who downloaded this.

First, I'd like to say, thanks.

But also, this is NOT the full version and thusly won't make much sense.

So basically, this mod does have a plot, but I haven't really figured out how to do animated
cutscenes yet plus there is meant to be two more characters for the first and third stages.

However, I am a college student, with a life, so I didn't have enough time for all that. 

Buuuuut maybe with enough support I'll get around to finishing it.




Anyways, context

Throw everything about the bf and fnf story put the window.The characters, story, and setting of
this mod are based on a webcomic called Odd Aesthetic.

You play as the main character, Jakku metta, having a rap battle with his buddies (though there's
only one at the moment). That buddie at the moment is ARM-X (no relation to charmx), a sentient
robot. The other two soon to be characters are Arora and Tomoko, the first and third stages
respectively. I also plan to, if this goes well, add on to the mod, similar to the tricky mod, with
a fourth stage revolving around the main antagonist of the series.

Oh also, there's a secret song found in the song selection. That one's just a joke, don't pay
attention to that.



so yeah, that's it for now, make sure to spread the word, and have fun funkin kids.
(also if you don't know how to install this mod, read the other txt file)
